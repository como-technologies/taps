//! The tick loop (spec §Module layout): fetch -> diff -> step -> execute -> persist.
//! Per-transition ordering (spec §Crash consistency):
//!   (1) persist new state + pending intents (tmp+rename+fsync) BEFORE executing
//!   (2) execute each action, probe-first
//!   (3) mark it done in the record
//!   (4) advance the forge cursor only after the tick's actions complete.
//! Crash anywhere -> restart converges: pending intents re-execute behind their
//! probes (at-least-once execution, exactly-once effect).
//!
//! The router owns ALL effects; `machine::step` is pure. The engine runs
//! synchronously inside `execute(RunEngine)`, and its `EngineFinished` result
//! feeds straight back through `step` + `apply` — so `Coding`/`Revising` only
//! ever persist as crash states.
