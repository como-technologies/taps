# CI Integration

adroit is built to bake the ADR process into a GitHub/GitLab pipeline. This
page covers the workflow it assumes, the two commands that gate it, and the
ready-to-copy templates.

## The two-stage workflow

1. **Propose on `main`.** ADR content is written and iterated directly on the
   default branch, as `status: proposed` pages under `wiki/decisions/`. No
   gate — capturing a decision should be low-friction.
2. **Decide via PR/MR.** The decision itself *is* the pull/merge request: it
   flips the page's `status:` frontmatter to `accepted` or `rejected` (in
   place — the file never moves). That PR/MR is where the team reviews and
   where the decision is recorded.

CI's job is to (a) keep every change structurally honest, and (b) give
reviewers a consistent brief on the decision PR/MR.

## The two gates

Both exit non-zero on a problem, so they drop straight into a CI job:

```sh
adroit check          # duplicate numbers, unparseable pages,
                      # broken supersession refs, broken links
adroit index --check  # fail if SUMMARY.md is out of date
```

Run them on every push/PR to `main`. A malformed ADR or a stale index then
can't merge. `check` prints each problem to stderr and exits non-zero;
`index --check` never writes — it just verifies `SUMMARY.md` matches what
`adroit index` would generate. (See the [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.md) for
both.)

A mispointed gate also fails: `--dir` must name an existing **KB space** (a
directory with `wiki.toml`). A missing path, or a directory that isn't a
space, is a non-zero exit with an error naming the problem — adroit never
creates the space, so a typo'd path can't produce a green `OK: 0 ADRs` run.
Repos that keep a committed legacy-format corpus bootstrap an ephemeral space
in CI first (`adroit seed --from <corpus> --dir <space>`) and gate on that.

## Concurrent ADR numbers across branches

Sequential `NNNN` numbers can **collide across branches**: if two people branch
off `main` and each run `adroit new`, both get the same next number — each branch
is internally consistent, but the duplicate only appears once both merge. This is
a known, unsolved limitation of sequential numbering across the ecosystem (see
[adr-tools #102](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/issues/102) and
[MADR #28](https://github.com/adr/madr/issues/28); log4brains eventually
[dropped sequential numbers entirely](https://thomvaill.github.io/log4brains/adr/adr/20201016-use-the-adr-slug-as-its-unique-id/)
to sidestep it).

`adroit check`'s duplicate-number rule is the enforcement point. The trick is to
run it on the **merged** state, and to **serialize merges** so two PRs/MRs can't
both go green and land a collision:

- **GitHub** — the `pull_request` job runs `adroit check` on the *merge ref*
  (your branch merged into the current `main`), so once one `0021` lands on
  `main`, the other PR's check sees both and fails. Make it airtight with a
  **merge queue**: the template also triggers on `merge_group`, so `check` runs
  on the queue's *speculative merge* of `main` + the PRs ahead + this PR — the
  collision surfaces there and the second PR is ejected. Mark **Validate ADRs** a
  **required status check** for the queue. (No queue? **Require branches to be up
  to date before merging** is the weaker fallback.)
- **GitLab** — a normal MR pipeline runs on the *source branch only*, so it won't
  see a number that's on `main` but not your branch. Enable **merged results
  pipelines** (runs `check` on the merged ref) and ideally **merge trains**
  (which serialize merges).
- **Safety net** — the `push` / `main` job runs `check` after every merge, so
  even if a race slips through it fails immediately on `main`. Resolve it with
  [`adroit renumber <old> <new>`](../reference/cli.md#adroit-renumber-old-new---file-path),
  which renames the file and fixes every inbound reference.

The real guarantee is serializing merges (merge queue / merge train); without it
there is always a small window where two PRs are both green and merge nearly
simultaneously — caught after the fact by the post-merge job.

## Stale links

A status change rewrites one file in place, so it can never strand a link —
two concurrent decision PRs edit disjoint files and never conflict. Links go
stale only when a file actually moves or is renamed: a `renumber`, or an edit
made outside adroit. `adroit check` reports a link that still names an existing
ADR as a **warning** (it exits 0), and a single `adroit relink` (idempotent)
canonicalizes the repo. The optional `relink.yml` workflow runs that heal on
`main` after each merge and commits the result — a no-op on a tidy repo.

## The review brief

On a decision PR/MR, generate the kickoff document and post it as the
description so reviewers get a consistent "here's what you're deciding" brief:

```sh
adroit review <number> --out kickoff.md
```

It includes the decision summary, key-docs links, the review timeline and
quorum, and what the merge changes — see
[`adroit review`](../reference/cli.md#adroit-review-number).

## Templates

Copy-and-customize starters live in the repo under
[`templates/ci/`](https://github.com/como-technologies/taps/tree/main/adroit/templates/ci):

- **GitHub Actions** → `templates/ci/github/adr.yml` → `.github/workflows/adr.yml`
  (validate + review brief), and `templates/ci/github/relink.yml` →
  `.github/workflows/adr-relink.yml` (the post-merge relink)
- **GitLab CI** → `templates/ci/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml` (includes the `adr:relink` job)

Each has two knobs at the top: `ADROIT_DIR` (your KB space root — the directory
holding `wiki.toml`) and how `adroit` is installed (it isn't on crates.io yet —
pin to a tag, vendor a binary, or use a prebuilt image). They're starting
points, not a framework — read them and make them yours.
