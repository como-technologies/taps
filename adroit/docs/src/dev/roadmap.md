# Roadmap

Directions and dispositions — not dated commitments. Most candidate items are
shaped to fit an existing
[seam](./architecture.md#seams-extend-by-adding-a-variant-not-editing-call-sites),
so they're "add a variant," not a rewrite. As of v0.2.0, every deferred lane
on this page is **retired by an accepted ADR with a recorded reopen
criterion** (the repo's `adr/accepted/` corpus — see
[Decision Records](./decisions.md)): retired is "not until the criterion
fires", never silent prose deferral.

## AI providers & retrieval

adroit's AI layer is built on the [rig](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig)
framework, behind the `AiProviderKind` seam (`anthropic` + `ollama` today).

- **More providers — retired (ADR-0016).** rig ships ~two dozen adapters
  (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, OpenRouter, …) and each is a one-line
  `AiProviderKind` variant + one rig-client arm in `rig_provider.rs` — which
  is exactly why the lane is retired rather than open-ended: anthropic +
  ollama cover the hosted and local lanes the suite actually runs. Reopen
  per-provider on a consumer with a concrete provider requirement (one
  `/extend` pass each).
- **Embeddings-based semantic retrieval — retired (ADR-0009).** `ask` /
  `related` / `dedupe` use mechanical TF-IDF, deterministically and offline.
  Deferred behind a **measured retrieval-miss** criterion that has never
  fired (no dogfood run has shown a miss, run-1 included). If it fires, rig's
  embeddings + `vector_store` drop in behind the same retrieval seam, paired
  with the files-derived cache design of the
  [read-model disposition](#deferred--retired-by-adr) (ADR-0014).
- **Granular AI-draft review in the TUI — retired (ADR-0017,** with the rest
  of the TUI widget lane**).** An AI draft loads into the editor to keep /
  trim as a whole; per-hunk accept/reject reopens only with a TUI-primary
  consumer who needs it.

## Interactive TUI

**Retired as a lane (ADR-0017).** The TUI uses a handful of ratatui widgets
(List, Paragraph, Scrollbar, …); several **out-of-the-box** ratatui widgets
map onto things adroit already computes — but every one of them is a
re-rendering of a view the CLI (`adroit stats`) or the web dashboard already
serves from the same `query`/`view` seam, and no TUI-primary consumer has
needed one. The one item that *was* load-bearing — the plan verb reading a
stored plan provider-free per ADR-0008 — was a consistency gap, and shipped
in v0.2.0. The retired candidates, each reopening individually on a
demonstrated TUI-primary need:

- **Tabbed multi-view** (`Tabs`) — List · Stats · Graph, instead of a single
  list+preview, so the TUI reaches parity with the web dashboard's pages.
- **In-terminal Insights** (`BarChart` / `Sparkline` / `Chart`) — render
  `query::stats` (status breakdown, created-over-time, review backlog) in the
  terminal, the way `adroit stats` does on the CLI.
- **Relationship graph in the terminal** (`Canvas`) — draw the supersession + typed-
  link graph (`query::graph`) as nodes/edges on a Canvas; the web shows it as SVG,
  the terminal could show it live.
- **Richer list** (`Table`) — columns for reference / status / created / review-due
  / link-count, replacing the hand-rolled `List` rows.
- **Review at a glance** (`Calendar` for `review_by` deadlines; `Gauge` /
  `LineGauge` for review-quorum progress).
- **Editor polish** — undo / redo, selection, and clipboard. The `EditorBuffer` is
  a deliberately minimal pure plain-text editor (with vi modal keys); richer editing
  is a possible future swap (a ratatui-0.30 text-area widget, kept to one ratatui in
  the tree).

## Forge, trackers & publishing

adroit reaches the outside world through narrow **Rust trait** seams, each
dispatched from config in `forge::open`, so a new provider is *one module + one
match arm* — no call-site changes:

- **`Forge`** — the PR/MR side (`open_pr` / `pr_state` / `merge_pr` / `comment_pr` …).
- **`Tracker`** — the issue side (`create_issue` / `transition` / `issue_state` …).
- **`Publisher`** — render the accepted set into a target's shape behind the
  `publish --to` flag: `static` (default), `mdbook`, `mkdocs`, `hugo`,
  `docusaurus`, `jekyll`. Pure + offline; adroit produces the tree, the consuming
  repo's CI hosts it (#8).

Every adapter takes an injectable `HttpTransport`, so each is unit-tested against a
fault-injected mock and the lifecycle cores run on mock adapters; the remaining
live-glue gap is issue + PR creation against a mock HTTP server with a real git
remote, proven per provider pairing
(#13–#15).

Providers grouped by seam — shipped, plus candidates (each a contained add,
**retired by ADR-0018**: the shipped set exceeds what any suite consumer
uses, and `/extend`-proven seam extensibility — not provider count — is the
property that matters; each candidate reopens on a consumer who actually
runs that system):

| Seam | Shipped | Candidates (retired, ADR-0018) |
|---|---|---|
| **Repo / PR host** (`Forge`) | GitHub, GitLab | Gitea / Forgejo, Bitbucket |
| **Issue tracker** (`Tracker`) | GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Jira, Linear + monday.com (#12; monday dogfood in progress, #26), native | Azure DevOps Boards, Asana |
| **Publish target** (`Publisher`) | static, mdBook, MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus, Jekyll (#8) | — (Confluence / Notion *hosting* is out of scope) |

Per-provider capability deepens behind the same traits — reviewer @-mentions + an MR
review-deadline label on `review --forge`, and the tracker's native due/target date
(Jira / GitLab / Linear / monday) on `set-review --forge`, shipped via the default-no-op
`Forge::add_label` / `Tracker::set_due_date` methods
(#11). The boundary that
keeps this in adroit's lane: its forge integration governs the **ADR lifecycle**
(propose-on-main, accept-via-MR, status sync, reviewer assignment), and `publish`
**produces** the accepted-set artifact (a static / `hugo-dir` / `docusaurus-dir`
tree) — it does not *host* it. The networked **Confluence / Notion push is the
consuming repo's CI** (e.g. a client corpus repo's mdBook → Confluence pipeline), not
adroit; and code orchestration across forges is the Adopt engine's. Those are other
nodes' jobs (see the portfolio loop below).

## Web dashboard

Both candidates **retired (ADR-0018)** — the dashboard's read-only-ness is a
stated security property, and no SME session has stalled on either gap:

- **Per-repo branding** — a configurable company name / logo / accent color
  (#16).
- **One-click "create MR"** from the dashboard — it stays read-only;
  authoring lives in the CLI / TUI
  (#10).

## Agent surface

- **Structured command manifest — shipped**
  (#17). `adroit manifest`
  emits a machine-readable JSON catalog of the CLI surface (commands + args +
  semantics, derived from the clap tree, plus `schemars` schemas of the `view`
  types) so agents discover and drive adroit without scraping `--help`. See
  [Automation & AI](../usage/automation.md#discovering-commands--adroit-manifest).
- **MCP server — shipped**
  (#19, follow-up to #17).
  `adroit mcp` is a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
  server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio) that projects the manifest's read verbs as MCP
  tools — each verb a tool with its args as a JSON Schema — so the portfolio's
  **Adopt**-stage agent engine (and any agent) drives adroit to read decisions and
  plans without scraping `--help`. Behind the default-on `mcp` feature; a
  hand-rolled JSON-RPC/stdio loop, no async runtime. **Read-only** — the read verbs
  (`list` / `show` / `search` /
  `stats` / `graph` / `check` / `plan` / `related` / `dedupe` / …) as tools, so an
  agent reads decisions + plans but can't mutate the repo over the wire.
  Exposing the **mutating** verbs was retired by ADR-0015 pending a real
  MCP-only consumer — and **reopened exactly on that criterion by ADR-0021**
  (portfolio ADR-0010 made the harness the primary human UI, so MCP-only
  harnesses like Claude Desktop are that consumer, bringing their own
  tool-call confirmation UX): `adroit mcp --allow-write` projects the guarded
  write slice (`new` / `compose` / `set-status`, plus `plan --save`) from the
  owned `manifest::mcp_write_slice` table, destructive-annotated, editor
  suppressed, forge / file-output escalations still stripped categorically.
  The default stays the categorical read-only server, pinned by the same
  conformance tests.

## Portfolio integration — the Como loop

> Tracked as an epic: #18.

adroit is the **Prescribe** node of the
[TAPS portfolio](https://github.com/como-technologies/taps/tree/main/portfolio)'s closed loop —
**Assess → Prescribe → Adopt → Measure → re-assess** — where every stage emits an
artifact the next consumes. adroit's job is deliberately narrow: **author and govern
decisions** (ADRs) and their implementation **plans**, and make them
machine-consumable. It is *not* the agent that writes the code, the layer that
orchestrates forges, or the system that hosts the published corpus — those are other nodes
(below). Holding that line is what keeps the seams clean.

The seam is the **manifest** — with the `-o json` `view` contract and the MCP
catalog (#19). Structured
JSON is how adroit's decisions cross into the rest of the loop, so a downstream agent
*reads* a decision instead of scraping prose. The ADRs and guides stay **markdown**
for humans; the *integration* contract is JSON.

- **Ingest (Assess → adroit) — shipped.** `adroit import --from-assessment <file>`
  turns an `assessments` export (the Domain → Practice → Question maturity model,
  each leaf carrying context / value / risk, as JSON / YAML / TOML) into a
  **proposed-ADR backlog** — one ADR per practice, mechanically — so the assessment
  becomes the decision backlog rather than dying in a doc. The optional `--ai`
  flesh-out pass (shipped) drafts richer prose for each seeded ADR from its
  assessment context, degrading to the mechanical seed when no provider is
  configured.
- **Emit (adroit → Adopt).** An accepted ADR plus its `plan` (the implementation
  checklist) is the decision context the **Adopt**-stage agentic engine (Conduit)
  turns into issues an agent works inside the team's own forge — read through the
  manifest / `-o json` / MCP, not by parsing files
  (#22 dogfoods that
  `plan -o json` ingest end-to-end through Conduit / tuesday). The exact read
  slice is **verified end to end on a live local model** — assessment →
  `import --ai` → accept → `plan --save` → the conduit-shaped `-o json` reads,
  with `plan` proven byte-deterministic — see
  [The Adopt read slice](./adopt-read-slice.md) (re-runnable via
  `just adopt-slice`). The PRs that engine
  ships are what **tuesday** then measures (effort / capacity), and which decisions
  actually landed re-opens the next assessment. adroit supplies *what was decided*;
  it does not run the build loop.
- **Stay in lane (the boundary that prevents overlap).** The forge-neutral,
  model-neutral *code* orchestration — the event router and PR/MR lifecycle that
  drive an agent identically across GitHub / GitLab / self-hosted forges — is the
  Adopt engine's net-new IP, not adroit's. Hosted distribution (a corpus repo's
  mdBook → Confluence CI, a future `publish` target) belongs to the publish seam, not
  to adroit's core. adroit's own forge integration stays scoped to ADR-lifecycle
  governance (the seam table above). Same loop, disjoint responsibilities.

These are **directions**, not committed APIs — but they're why the seams
(`query` / `view`, `-o json`, the manifest, the publish + AI seams) are shaped the
way they are: each is a typed boundary another node can consume.

## Deferred / retired by ADR

- **Database-backed read model — retired (ADR-0014).** A database-backed
  store (SurrealDB / SQLite) was floated while dogfooding for richer
  relational queries. Plain markdown files stay the **only** source of truth
  (the ADR-0003 invariant): ADRs are git-reviewable and PR-diffable, there's
  no separate state to back up / migrate, and performance is
  millisecond-scale on every real corpus. Reopen criterion (now binding in
  the ADR): a concrete query/graph need at a corpus scale where re-scanning
  is measurably too slow — at which point an embedded index built *from* the
  files lands behind the existing `query` / `view` seam, doubling as the
  embeddings vector cache (ADR-0009) if that criterion ever fires too.
- **Published distribution (crates.io / prebuilt binaries) — retired
  (ADR-0013).** Build-from-source plus the local tagged release (ADR-0012)
  serves every consumer at the current rung; publishing is an owner-only
  act. Reopens with a declared self-serve direction.
- **Release discipline — adopted (ADR-0012).** Local annotated tags +
  version bumps + the book's [Changelog](../reference/changelog.md)
  chapter; tags stay local until the owner publishes.

> Want one of these? adroit's seams make most of them a contained change — the
> `/extend` skill ([Project Skills](./skills.md)) is the per-seam checklist.
