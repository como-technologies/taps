# CLI Reference

## Global options

### Repo selection

`--dir` is **global** — inherited by every subcommand, shown under **Repo
selection** in each `--help`, and accepted before *or* after the subcommand
(`adroit --dir X list` and `adroit list --dir X` are equivalent). It names a
**KB space root** (the directory holding `wiki.toml`; ADR-0020) — decision
pages live at `<wiki_root>/decisions/` inside it. The directory must exist and
be a space: a missing path or a non-space is a **non-zero error** naming the
bootstrap path (see [Your repo](../usage/your-repo.md)); the scaffolding
commands (`new` / `import` / `init` / `seed`) create the `decisions/` dir
inside an existing space, never the space itself.

The on-disk **shape** flags below (`--naming`, `--date-source`) are also
**global** — accepted before *or* after the subcommand — but **hidden** from
the concise `-h` / `--help` so the default help stays a clean command list.
They surface on `adroit --help-all` (the full reference). Most teams set them
once via `config` / `.env` (the `ADROIT_*` env var binds everywhere regardless
of position) rather than passing them per-command.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--dir <PATH>` / `-d` | `~/.local/share/adroit/` | Path to the KB space root (env: `ADROIT_DIR`; overrides config) |
| `--naming <sequential\|date\|uuid>` | `sequential` | How ADR identifiers/filenames are formed (env: `ADROIT_NAMING`; overrides config). See [Naming schemes](./adr-format.md#naming-schemes) |
| `--date-source <auto\|git\|filesystem>` | `auto` | Where ADR dates come from: `auto` (git when available, else filesystem), `git` (require git; warn if unavailable/shallow), `filesystem` (never shell git) (env: `ADROIT_DATE_SOURCE`; overrides config) |

### Command defaults

Top-level only — pass them *before* the subcommand (e.g. `adroit --theme gruvbox`)
or, more usually, set them in config / `.env`. The environment variable binds
everywhere regardless; the flag is kept off the concise help (it's under
`--help-all`), since just a few commands use each.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--theme <gruvbox\|warm\|default>` | `gruvbox` | TUI color theme (chrome + markdown preview); the TUI and `serve` use it (env: `ADROIT_THEME`; overrides config) |
| `--review-overdue-days <N>` | `30` | Days after which a Proposed ADR with no `review_by` is flagged review-due; `0` disables. Used by `list`/`stats`/`check` (env: `ADROIT_REVIEW_OVERDUE_DAYS`; overrides config) |
| `--default-template <name\|path>` | `madr` | Default template for `new` — `madr`/`nygard` or a path (env: `ADROIT_TEMPLATE`; overrides config; `new --template` still wins) |

### Help

`-h` and `--help` show the **same concise** view — the command list plus the
everyday options (`--dir`, `--output`). **`--help-all`** adds every option in
full detail (the repo-shape + command-default flags above, with their possible
values). Both work on the top level and on each subcommand (`adroit new --help`
vs `adroit new --help-all`). `--version` prints the version.

### Output

Global — works before *or* after any verb (`adroit list -o json`). Selects how the
**read** verbs print their result.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-o`, `--output <human\|json>` | `human` | Result format for `list` / `show` / `search` / `stats` / `graph` / `check`. `json` emits the structured `view` types — the same contract the web API returns — for scripts and AI agents. Other verbs ignore it. |

`json` goes to **stdout**; warnings/errors go to **stderr**. `check -o json` still
exits non-zero on an Error-severity problem, so a CI gate or agent can branch on
the exit code while parsing the report from stdout. See
[Automation & AI](../usage/automation.md).

Each also reads from an environment variable, so you don't have to pass it on
every command: `ADROIT_DIR`, `ADROIT_THEME`, `ADROIT_REVIEW_OVERDUE_DAYS`,
`ADROIT_TEMPLATE`, `ADROIT_DATE_SOURCE`, `ADROIT_NAMING` (and, for the web
dashboard, `ADROIT_HOST` / `ADROIT_PORT`).
A `.env` file in the current directory (or a parent) is loaded automatically
at startup, so you can keep your repo location there. Copy the tracked
`.env.example` to get started (your local `.env` is git-ignored):

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# .env
ADROIT_DIR=/path/to/kb-space
```

Precedence for the ADR directory, highest first: the `--dir` flag, then the
`ADROIT_DIR` environment variable (a real shell variable wins over one from a
`.env` file), then a `dir` entry in `~/.config/adroit/config.yaml`, then the
default `~/.local/share/adroit/`.

The one on-disk format is the **KB decision page** (frontmatter over a prose
body, flat layout) — see [ADR Format](./adr-format.md). A legacy corpus enters
a fresh space via [`adroit seed`](#adroit-seed---from-legacy-dir---dry-run).

## Commands

These mirror `adroit --help`, grouped by workflow stage — reading top to bottom tracks a decision's life.

### Author a decision

#### `adroit new <TITLE>`

Create a new ADR with the given title: a `proposed` decision page in the space's `decisions/` directory (created inside the space if missing), scaffolded from a template and opened in your editor.

```sh
adroit new "Use PostgreSQL for primary datastore"
adroit new "Use Redis" --template nygard   # pick a template by name or path
adroit new "Use Redis" --no-edit           # skip opening the editor
adroit new "Adopt feature flags" --interview   # AI drafts the body from a short Q&A
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--template <name\|path>` | Template to scaffold from (`madr`, `nygard`, or a file path) |
| `--no-edit` | Do not open the editor after creating the ADR |
| `--force` | Create even if an ADR with this exact title already exists (skip the duplicate guard) |
| `--interview` | Run a short Socratic interview and have the configured AI provider draft the body from your answers + the existing corpus (opt-in). See [AI-assisted authoring](../usage/automation.md#ai-assisted-authoring) |

**Duplicate guard.** `new` is an imperative event — it always allocates the next
number, so it is **not** idempotent (running it twice makes two ADRs). To catch
the *accidental* re-run, it checks for an ADR with the same (case-insensitive)
title first: it warns and lists the match plus the most similar existing ADRs
(via the same engine as [`dedupe`](#adroit-related-id--adroit-dedupe-id)), then,
on a terminal, prompts `[y/N]` before creating. On a non-terminal (scripts/CI) it
warns and proceeds; `--force` skips the check entirely.

With `--interview`, the identity, status, and heading stay mechanical — the AI
only writes the prose sections, marked `<!-- adroit:ai-suggested -->` for you to
review and edit before committing. If no provider is configured it degrades to
the plain template (the ADR is still created).

#### `adroit import --from-assessment <FILE>`

Seed a **proposed-ADR backlog** from an [`assessments`](../usage/automation.md)
export — the *ingest* seam (Assess → Prescribe). Reads a `Domain → Practice →
Question` maturity model (`.json`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, or `.toml`) and creates one **proposed**
ADR per practice: the practice's *context* → problem statement, its *value* /
*risk* / *effort* → decision drivers, its questions → recorded signals. The body is
marked `<!-- adroit:seeded-from-assessment -->` with a provenance note. The mapping
is **mechanical** — no AI, no network — so identity / status / heading stay fixed;
the seeded prose is a starting point to refine (`adroit draft <id>`, `edit`).

```sh
adroit import --from-assessment maturity.json
adroit import --from-assessment maturity.yaml --dry-run    # preview, write nothing
adroit import --from-assessment maturity.yaml -o json      # machine seed summary
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--from-assessment <FILE>` | Path to the assessment export (`.json`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, or `.toml`) |
| `--dry-run` | Parse and report what would be seeded; write nothing |
| `--force` | Seed even practices whose title already has an ADR (skip the dedupe guard) |
| `--ai` | After the mechanical seed, have the provider flesh out each ADR's prose from the assessment context. Degrades to the mechanical seed (with a warning) when no provider is available. Needs `ai.enabled` or `ADROIT_AI_FAKE` |

**Re-runnable.** Practices whose (case-insensitive) title already has an ADR are
skipped — `(N skipped — already present)` — so importing an *updated* assessment
only adds what's new. Pass `--force` to seed anyway. With `-o json` the run emits an
`ImportSummary` machine summary (`seeded` / `skipped`) on stdout instead of the
human report — see
[Automation & AI](../usage/automation.md#-o-json-on-the-read-verbs-and-import).
See [The ADR Workflow](../usage/workflow.md#seed-a-backlog-from-an-assessment--adroit-import).

#### `adroit draft <ID>`

The **after-the-fact `new --interview`**: run the same AI interview on an ADR you
already created. Use it when you made an ADR with a plain `adroit new "Title"`
(a bare template) and want to fill it in later — at any point before review.

It asks the same Socratic questions, drafts the body from your answers + the
corpus, and **splices** it over the prose — the `# ADR-NNNN` heading and
`## Status` stay mechanical — marks it `<!-- adroit:ai-suggested -->`, then opens
your editor. So the iterative flow is: `new` → (`draft` whenever you want AI help)
→ `edit` / hand-tune → PR. Needs an AI provider (no template fallback, since the
ADR already exists).

```sh
adroit draft 2            # interview + draft ADR-0002, then open the editor to review
adroit draft 2 --no-edit  # draft it without opening the editor
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--no-edit` | Do not open the editor after drafting |

#### `adroit compose <ID> "<instruction>"`

The **targeted, instruction-driven** revision verb. Where `draft` re-runs the
fixed interview and redrafts the whole body, `compose` takes a **free-form
instruction** plus the ADR's *current* body and returns a revised body — for
iterative edits to an ADR that already has content. It splices the result over the
prose (the `# ADR-NNNN` heading and `## Status` stay mechanical), marks it
`<!-- adroit:ai-suggested -->`, then opens your editor. Same engine as the TUI's
"AI: draft / revise body" assist. Needs an AI provider (no template fallback).

```sh
adroit compose 2 "expand the negative consequences"
adroit compose 2 "add a rejected option about Redis" --no-edit
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--no-edit` | Do not open the editor after composing |

#### `adroit plan <ID>`

Draft an **AI implementation plan** for an (accepted) ADR: reads the ADR + the
existing corpus and asks the configured AI provider for an ordered, actionable
checklist (steps, components touched, testing, rollout, risks). **Read-only** —
it never modifies the ADR. Prints to stdout unless `--out <PATH>` is given. With
`-o json` it emits a `Plan` envelope (`{ reference, title, plan }`, the `plan` a
markdown string) to stdout — the plan tagged with its ADR identity for an agent to
consume. Needs an AI provider — see
[AI-assisted authoring](../usage/automation.md#ai-assisted-authoring).

```sh
adroit plan 21                       # print the plan
adroit plan 21 --out plan-0021.md    # write it to a file
adroit plan 21 -o json               # structured { reference, title, plan }
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--out <PATH>` | Write the plan to a file instead of stdout |

#### `adroit edit <ID>`

Open an ADR in your editor (`<ID>` resolved as in [`show`](#adroit-show-id)).

```sh
adroit edit 1
```

adroit finds your editor using this precedence chain:

1. The `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` environment variable (session override)
2. The `editor` field in `config.yaml` (see [Configuration](#configuration))
3. Auto-detection — probes your PATH for common editors (nano, vim, nvim, VS Code, etc.)
4. Interactive prompt — if nothing is detected and you're in a terminal, adroit asks you to choose from the editors installed on your system. Your choice is saved to `config.yaml` so you're only asked once.

#### `adroit lint <ID>`

Check one ADR's **authoring quality** (read-only) — distinct from `check`, which
validates structural repo integrity. The mechanical checks need no AI: sections
still left as their italic `_…_` prompt, a missing or empty
`### Negative Consequences`, and fewer than two recorded options under
`## Considered Options` (list items and `###` sub-headings both count). The
prompt check is template-agnostic — any section whose only content is the prompt
the template shipped. `--ai` adds a model review against ADR best
practices + house style (needs a provider; see
[AI-assisted authoring](../usage/automation.md#ai-assisted-authoring)). Exits
**non-zero** on mechanical findings, so it works as an authoring gate; the AI
review is advisory. `-o json` emits the findings.

```sh
adroit lint 21            # mechanical checks
adroit lint 21 --ai       # + an AI review
adroit lint 21 -o json    # structured findings for an editor/agent
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--ai` | Also run an AI review (needs a configured AI provider) |

#### `adroit related <ID>` / `adroit dedupe <ID>`

Find ADRs textually similar to a given one — **mechanical** (TF-IDF cosine over
titles + bodies), no AI and no provider. `related` surfaces similar ADRs the
target **isn't already linked to** (candidates to `link`); `dedupe` includes the
linked ones and is framed for catching "did we already decide this?" before a new
ADR re-litigates a decision. Read-only; `-o json` emits the ranked matches
(`reference`, `title`, `score`).

```sh
adroit related 21            # similar ADRs you might want to link
adroit dedupe 21 -o json     # overlaps as JSON, highest score first
```

> Similarity is lexical for now (shared significant terms); a semantic
> (embeddings) upgrade is future work.

#### `adroit link <ID> <--relates-to|--depends-on|--refines> <TARGET>`

Add (or remove with `--remove`) a **typed relational link** from `<ID>` to
`<TARGET>` (both addressed as in [`show`](#adroit-show-id)). Exactly one of the
three kind flags names the target. The link is recorded in `<ID>`'s frontmatter,
listed by `adroit show`, and drawn as a distinct edge in the dashboard's
relationship graph. Adding validates that the target exists.

The links are structured frontmatter ref-list fields. See
[ADR Format → Relationships](./adr-format.md#relationships).

```sh
adroit link 6 --depends-on 2          # ADR-0006 depends on ADR-0002
adroit link 6 --relates-to 4
adroit link 6 --refines 3
adroit link 6 --depends-on 2 --remove
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--relates-to <TARGET>` | A non-directional related link |
| `--depends-on <TARGET>` | This ADR depends on the target |
| `--refines <TARGET>` | This ADR refines / elaborates the target |
| `--remove` | Remove the link instead of adding it |

### Review & decide

#### `adroit set-review <ID> <DATE>`

Set (or clear) an ADR's **review deadline** as an ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DD` date. A
still-`Proposed` ADR whose deadline has passed is flagged **review-due** in
`stats` and the web dashboard's "Review due" panel.

In markdown mode this writes a `Review by: <date>` line into the `## Status`
region (format-preserving — only that line changes). In frontmatter mode it sets
the optional `review_by` field. Pass `--clear` to remove the deadline.

With `--forge`, it also comments the deadline on the linked issue/PR **and** sets
the tracker's **native due/target date** — Jira due date, GitLab issue due date,
Linear target date, or monday's first date column (GitHub Issues have none, so it's
a no-op there). `--clear` clears the native date too.

```sh
adroit set-review 3 2026-07-15   # propose a review by July 15
adroit set-review 3 --clear      # remove the deadline
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--clear` | Remove the review deadline instead of setting one |

#### `adroit review <NUMBER>`

Generate a **review-kickoff** document for an ADR — the doc the team writes when
opening an ADR for formal review. It mirrors the hand-written artifact: an H1
with the date and ADR number, a "What you're being asked to do" section, a
**Key docs** table (the ADR, the ADR README, the review-process guide), the
review timeline and quorum, what happens on the decision date, and a collapsible
"What the MR changes" block. Placeholders (`[TODO: ...]`) are left for the
proposer to fill in.

This is **pure generation** — it performs no git operations and does not modify
the ADR. The ADR is resolved by number through the store and errors cleanly if
the number isn't found. Because the kickoff doc is built around the ADR number,
`review` is **numeric-only** (requires the `sequential` scheme).

With `--forge`, it also posts the kickoff as a comment on the linked issue/PR,
**@-mentions** the configured reviewer pool (`forge.reviewers`), and tags the
PR/MR with a `review-by:<deadline>` label (the deadline is the review window's
last day).

Dates are computed from today using business days (weekends skipped):
the review period runs from today to today + `--days` business days, and the
decision date is the next business day after that.

```sh
adroit review 1                              # print to stdout
adroit review 1 --days 5 --quorum 3          # 5-business-day window, quorum 3
adroit review 1 --out review-kickoff.md      # write to a file
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--days <N>` | config `review_days` (3) | Review period length in business days |
| `--quorum <N>` | config `review_quorum` (3) | Number of approvals required |
| `--out <PATH>` | — | Write the doc to a file instead of stdout (long-only; `-o`/`--output` is the global result-format selector) |

#### `adroit summarize <ID>`

A one-paragraph, plain-language **AI TL;DR** of an ADR — for a PR description, a
chat notification, or a decision-log entry. Read-only; prints to stdout unless
`--out <PATH>`. Needs an AI provider (see
[AI-assisted authoring](../usage/automation.md#ai-assisted-authoring)).

```sh
adroit summarize 21
adroit summarize 21 --out tldr.md
```

#### `adroit set-status <ID> <STATUS>`

Set the lifecycle status of an ADR (`<ID>` resolved as in [`show`](#adroit-show-id)).
Status names are case-insensitive. The page's `status:` frontmatter is
rewritten **in place** (minimal-diff — the file never moves). Mirrors
[`set-review`](#adroit-set-review-id-date).

Valid statuses: `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `deprecated`, `superseded`.

With `--forge` it also drives the PR/issue (on `accepted`: verify approvals + CI,
merge, close); `--quorum <N>` overrides the required approval count for that run
(default: config `review_quorum`). See [Forge Integration](../usage/forge.md).

```sh
adroit set-status 1 accepted
adroit set-status 1 accepted --forge --quorum 1 --yes   # solo repo: 1 approval
```

#### `adroit supersede <NEW> <OLD>`

Mark `<OLD>` as superseded by `<NEW>` in one command (each addressed as in
[`show`](#adroit-show-id)): sets the old ADR's status to `superseded` and
records `superseded_by:` in its frontmatter (in place), and adds a reciprocal
`Supersedes [<OLD>](...)` note to the new ADR's body. Works under every naming
scheme — the refs carry the scheme's reference (a number or a slug).

```sh
adroit supersede 6 2                 # sequential
adroit supersede 20260601-b 20260515-a   # date scheme
```

### Explore the corpus

#### `adroit list [--status <STATUS>]`

List ADRs as a table showing number, status, and title. Recurses into all status directories in by-status mode. Pass `--status` to filter.

```sh
adroit list
adroit list --status accepted
```

#### `adroit show <ID>`

Display a single ADR: its status, creation and
last-modified dates, supersession links, path, body, and — when the repo is a
git repository — a **History** timeline of its lifecycle (proposed → accepted /
rejected / superseded), with the date and commit subject of each transition.

`<ID>` is resolved through the configured [naming scheme](./adr-format.md#naming-schemes):
a number (`9` or `ADR-0009`) under `sequential`, the filename slug under `date`,
or a unique leading prefix of the UUID under `uuid`.

```sh
adroit show 1                       # sequential
adroit show 20260601-adopt-postgresql   # date scheme
```

Dates and the timeline are read from **git history**, not the file: the first
commit that added the ADR is its creation, and each status change is a directory
move git records. Outside a git repository adroit falls back to the file's
modification time, and the timeline is omitted. See
[ADR Format](./adr-format.md#dates-come-from-git).

#### `adroit status <ID>`

Print an ADR's current status — just the word, **lowercase** (`<ID>` resolved as
in [`show`](#adroit-show-id)). It's a focused, scriptable getter: the output
feeds straight into [`set-status`](#adroit-set-status-id-status) or a shell test,
and matches the by-status directory names. For the full record use
[`show`](#adroit-show-id) (whose `Status:` line is the capitalized display form).

```sh
adroit status 1            # -> proposed
[ "$(adroit status 1)" = accepted ] && echo "ready to publish"
```

#### `adroit search <TERM>`

Case-insensitive search across ADR titles and bodies (recursive). Prints number, status, and title for each match.

```sh
adroit search postgres
adroit search postgres -o json   # structured matches for scripts/agents
```

#### `adroit stats`

Repo statistics: total ADRs, a per-status breakdown (a colored bar chart), the
oldest still-`Proposed` ADRs (with review-due flags), and a created-per-month
histogram. `-o json` emits the full `view::Stats`.

```sh
adroit stats
adroit stats -o json
```

#### `adroit graph`

The ADR relationship graph — supersession plus typed (`relates_to` /
`depends_on` / `refines`) links. The human view is a **tree**: each ADR with
outgoing relationships, its edges indented beneath it (with an `unconnected:`
footnote for isolated ADRs); `-o json` emits `view::Graph` (the same nodes/edges
the web dashboard's relationship graph consumes).

```sh
adroit graph
adroit graph -o json
```

> Human output is colored (status, edge kinds, scores) when stdout is a terminal;
> it's plain under a pipe, `-o json`, or `NO_COLOR`.

#### `adroit ask "<question>"`

Ask a natural-language question of the ADR corpus. Retrieval is **mechanical**
(TF-IDF over your question picks the most relevant ADRs); the configured **AI
provider** then synthesizes an answer, citing the ADRs it used. Read-only. The
human view prints the answer to stdout and the sources to stderr; `-o json` emits
`{ "answer": …, "sources": [refs] }`. Needs an AI provider (see
[AI-assisted authoring](../usage/automation.md#ai-assisted-authoring)).

```sh
adroit ask "Why did we pick Postgres over MySQL?"
adroit ask "What did we decide about caching?" -o json
```

#### `adroit serve` (requires the `web` feature)

Serve the read-only web dashboard (browse, search, stats, relationship graph,
repo-health checks) over a local HTTP server. Built behind the `web` Cargo feature; without it the
command prints a rebuild hint and exits. See [Web Dashboard](../usage/web.md).

```sh
cargo run --features web -- serve                      # http://127.0.0.1:8080
cargo run --features web -- serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--host <ADDR>` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to bind (env: `ADROIT_HOST`) |
| `--port <N>` | `8080` | Port to listen on (env: `ADROIT_PORT`) |

#### `adroit` (no command)

Launch the interactive TUI (browse, triage, in-terminal body editing). The TUI
opens the same ADR directory the CLI resolves — `adroit --dir X` launches the
TUI against `X`. In a non-interactive context (no TTY) it prints a hint and
exits instead of seizing the terminal. Built behind the `tui` Cargo feature
(on by default); without it, a hint points you at the CLI subcommands.

### Maintain the repo

#### `adroit check`

Validate the ADR repo and **exit non-zero if any error-severity problem is
found** — a structural CI gate. Problems are listed on stderr. A clean repo
prints `OK: N ADRs, no problems`; a repo with only warnings prints
`OK: N ADRs, M warning(s)` and still exits 0 (so a deferred-relink PR branch,
whose inbound links aren't canonicalized yet, isn't blocked). Only **errors**
fail the build.

It checks for:

1. **Status ↔ directory mismatch** (by-status only): a file's `## Status`
   section declares a status that disagrees with the directory it lives in. A
   section with no explicit status word is fine (the directory is the source of
   truth).
2. **Duplicate identifiers**: two ADR files sharing the same identity under the
   configured [naming scheme](./adr-format.md#naming-schemes) — the same `NNNN`
   for `sequential`, or the same slug/uuid for `date`/`uuid`.
3. **Unparseable pages**: a `.md` page whose frontmatter fails to parse.
4. **Broken supersession refs**: a `supersedes:` / `superseded_by:` ref
   naming an ADR that doesn't exist in the space.
5. **Broken / stale / external links**: a relative `.md` link that points
   somewhere other than its target's current home. The split is
   identity-based: a link naming an ADR that still exists is a **stale** link
   (a **warning** — `adroit relink` fixes it); a link naming an ADR that no
   longer exists anywhere is a **broken** link (an **error**); a missing
   target that is not an ADR link at all (a book page, an asset) is an
   **external** link (a **warning**) — it leaves the corpus, and a seeded
   ephemeral space can never resolve it, so validating it is the owning
   repo's job. External URLs and anchors are ignored.
6. **Duplicate titles** (a **warning**): two or more ADRs share the same
   (case-insensitive) title — usually an accidental re-run of `new`. Titles *can*
   legitimately repeat, so this never fails the gate; it just surfaces the dups.

Of these, duplicate identifiers, unparseable pages, broken supersession refs,
and broken links are **errors** (they fail `check`); stale links, external
links, and duplicate titles are **warnings** (reported, but `check` still
exits 0).

```sh
adroit check
```

The same validation runs behind the web dashboard's **repo-health panel** (via
`GET /api/check`), so the issues `check` reports on the command line also show up
there — see [Web Dashboard](../usage/web.md).

#### `adroit relink`

Rewrite every cross-ADR relative link so it points at the ADR's **current**
location, then write back only the files that changed. Use it to repair links
left stale by a `renumber` or by edits made outside adroit (and as a post-merge
CI step). On a tidy repo this is a no-op (`Links already canonical — nothing to
relink.`). Idempotent; links by external URL, anchor, or to non-ADR files are
left untouched; ambiguous duplicate numbers are skipped (and flagged by
`check`). Pass `--dry-run` to list the files/links that would change without
writing anything.

```sh
adroit relink              # rewrite stale links in place
adroit relink --dry-run    # show what would change, write nothing
```

#### `adroit renumber <OLD> <NEW> [--file <PATH>]`

Renumber a sequential ADR — to resolve a duplicate `NNNN` (e.g. two branches
that each created `0009`). It renames the file (slug preserved), rewrites its
`# ADR-NNNN:` heading, and **retargets + relabels every inbound reference**
(`[ADR-OLD](…)` → `[ADR-NEW](…)`), then relinks. References are matched by
filename, so a duplicate-numbered sibling with a different slug is left
untouched.

```sh
adroit renumber 9 21                       # ADR-0009 -> ADR-0021
# When two files share 0009, point at the one to move:
adroit renumber 9 21 --file proposed/0009-adopt-crossplane.md
```

`<NEW>` must be unused; an ambiguous `<OLD>` (two files) errors unless you pass
`--file`. (Sequential scheme only.)

#### `adroit seed --from <LEGACY-DIR> [--dry-run]`

Bootstrap a **legacy corpus** — pre-KB `# ADR-NNNN:`-style markdown, in
by-status subdirectories (`proposed/ accepted/ rejected/ superseded/
deprecated/`) or one flat directory — into the (fresh) target space as KB
decision pages. Preserves number → `reference`, title, status, supersession
refs, review deadline, and body; a legacy `Created:` date becomes the page's
`created`, and the H1 / `> State:` banner / `## Status` region move into
frontmatter. See [ADR Format → Seeding a legacy
corpus](./adr-format.md#seeding-a-legacy-corpus) for the exact mapping.

```sh
# Stand up an ephemeral space and seed it from the committed corpus:
printf 'name = "adrs"\n' > /tmp/space/wiki.toml
mkdir -p /tmp/space/wiki/decisions
adroit seed --from docs/src/adr --dir /tmp/space
adroit check --dir /tmp/space
```

`seed` **refuses a target space that already contains any ADR** (it only fills
a fresh space, which is what makes it safe to run from a gate) and exits
non-zero on a parse/validation failure (an unparseable document, a missing
number, a duplicate number). `--dry-run` prints the plan without writing.

#### `adroit index [--check]`

Regenerate the ADR section of `SUMMARY.md`, grouped by status, preserving the non-ADR parts of the file. If no `summary_path` is configured and no `SUMMARY.md` is found next to or one level above the ADR directory, the generated block is printed to stdout.

With `--check`, adroit does **not** write: it compares what it *would* generate
against the on-disk `SUMMARY.md` and exits non-zero if they differ (printing
`SUMMARY.md is out of date — run \`adroit index\``), making it a CI gate for
documentation drift. If no `SUMMARY.md` is found it prints a note and exits 0.

```sh
adroit index           # regenerate SUMMARY.md (or print the block)
adroit index --check    # verify SUMMARY.md is up to date; non-zero if stale
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Verify `SUMMARY.md` is up to date without writing; exit non-zero if stale |

#### `adroit publish --out <DIR> [--to <TARGET>]`

Render the accepted ADR set into a static-site shape. `--out <OUT>` is
**required**; `--dry-run` previews the export without writing. `--to` selects the
target — `static` (default), `mdbook`, `mkdocs`, `hugo`, `docusaurus`, or
`jekyll` — and can also be set via the `publish_target` config key /
`ADROIT_PUBLISH_TARGET`. Pure and offline; re-running overwrites idempotently.
adroit *produces* the tree; a consuming repo's CI hosts it. See
[Publishing](../usage/publishing.md).

```sh
adroit publish --out ./public/adrs            # static dir (default)
adroit publish --to hugo --out ./site/content # Hugo content section
adroit publish --to mkdocs --out ./site --dry-run
```

### Forge integration

Drive the linked GitHub/GitLab issue + PR. In the default build but **off** until
you configure `forge.*`; every action is opt-in and previews by default. See
[Forge Integration](../usage/forge.md) for the full workflow.

#### `adroit init`

Interactive wizard — detect the forge from the git remote and write the `forge.*`
config. `--print` shows the detected settings + planned steps without writing;
`--yes` runs a non-interactive setup from the detected defaults.

#### `adroit auth <PROVIDER>`

Store a token (`github` / `gitlab` / `jira` / `linear` / `monday`, or `anthropic`
for the AI key) — in the **OS keychain** when available (macOS Keychain / Windows
Credential Manager / Linux keyutils), else a `0600` file next to the config. The
token value is never echoed; env vars (`ADROIT_*_TOKEN` / `ADROIT_ANTHROPIC_KEY`)
still take precedence at use time.

With no `--token`, GitHub/GitLab try an **OAuth device-flow** login when
`forge.oauth_client_id` is set (print a URL + code, approve in the browser, store
the granted token); otherwise you're prompted for the token, hidden. `--email`
saves the Jira account email. `ADROIT_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file|keychain` forces a
storage backend. See [Forge Integration → Authenticate](../usage/forge.md#2-authenticate).

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--token <T>` | Provide the token directly (skips device flow / prompt) |
| `--email <E>` | For `jira`: the account email saved alongside the token |

#### `adroit sync <ID>`

Refresh the ADR's linked PR/MR description from its current content. Previews
unless you pass `--yes`.

#### `adroit reconcile`

Reconcile local ADR status with the forge after out-of-band changes (e.g. a PR
merged in the web UI). Reports drift by default; `--yes` applies the fixable part.

#### `adroit notify <ID>`

Post the ADR's current state to a chat webhook (Slack/Teams-compatible).
`--dry-run` previews the message without posting.

> `new --forge`, `review --forge`, and `set-status --forge` add forge actions to
> those verbs — see each in [Author a decision](#author-a-decision) /
> [Review & decide](#review--decide) and the [Forge Integration](../usage/forge.md) guide.

### Configuration

#### `adroit config [show | get <key> | set <key> <value> [--local]]`

Inspect or change configuration.

- **`adroit config`** (or `config show`) lists every setting with its **resolved
  value and source** — `flag`, `env`, `config` (set in `config.yaml`), or
  `default` — which is the quickest way to answer "why is my layout `flat`?"
  given the precedence chain (flag > env/`.env` > `config.yaml` > default).
- **`adroit config get <key>`** prints one resolved value (scriptable).
- **`adroit config set <key> <value>`** persists to `config.yaml` (validated
  against the key's type). With **`--local`** it instead upserts `KEY=value` into
  a `.env` in the current directory (a per-project / per-machine override) — only
  for keys that have an environment variable.

```sh
adroit config                          # show all settings + where each came from
adroit config get naming
adroit config set date_source git      # -> ~/.config/adroit/config.yaml
adroit config set naming date --local  # -> ./.env  (ADROIT_NAMING=date)
```

`config` works even without a resolvable ADR space (it's about settings, not
ADRs), so you can use it to diagnose a misconfiguration. `config get`/`set`
cover the **scalar** keys in the [Configuration](#configuration) table below;
`templates_dir` and `summary_path` are set by editing `config.yaml` directly.

#### `adroit completions <SHELL>`

Print a shell completion script to stdout, generated from adroit's command tree
(so it always matches your installed version — and a build without the `forge`
feature omits the forge commands/flags). `<SHELL>` is `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`,
`powershell`, or `elvish`.

The quickest way (kubectl-style) — source it from your shell's startup file so
it loads every session:

```sh
# ~/.bashrc
. <(adroit completions bash)

# ~/.zshrc   (ensure `autoload -U compinit && compinit` runs after)
. <(adroit completions zsh)

# fish
adroit completions fish | source
```

Or install the script to the location your shell scans, which is faster to load
and survives without adroit on `PATH` at startup:

```sh
# bash (system-wide)
adroit completions bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/adroit > /dev/null
# zsh (a dir on your $fpath, e.g.)
adroit completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_adroit
# fish
adroit completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/adroit.fish
```

Completion covers subcommands, flags, and enum values (e.g. `--naming
sequential|date|uuid`, `set-status <TAB>` → the status names).

#### `adroit manifest`

Print a **machine-readable JSON catalog** of the CLI surface — every command (only
those compiled into this build), its args / flags / enums / defaults, plus
semantics `--help` only implies: `reads` / `writes`, `idempotent`, the `cost`
profile (`local` / `provider-call` / `network` / `long-running`), lifecycle
`stage`, the `-o json` output shape, any runtime `requires` (e.g. `ai.enabled`), and
the `exit`-code meaning — alongside JSON Schemas of every structured output shape
(the `view` types plus `LintFinding` / `Match` / `AskAnswer`). For agents and
tooling that discover and drive adroit without scraping `--help`. Offline; reflects
exactly this build. See
[Automation & AI](../usage/automation.md#discovering-commands--adroit-manifest).

```sh
adroit manifest | jq '.commands[] | select(.reads) | .name'      # the read verbs
adroit manifest | jq '.commands[] | select(.cost!="local") | {name,cost}'  # what to rate-limit
adroit manifest | jq '.types.AdrSummary'                         # the list/search shape
```

#### `adroit mcp`

Run a **[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server** on
stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0), exposing adroit's **read-only** verbs as MCP **tools** so an
MCP client (Claude / Claude Code, an editor, an agent) drives adroit without
scraping `--help`. The tools are projected from `manifest`, so the surface can't
drift; a `tools/call` runs the verb and returns its `-o json` output. Read-only
by default — repo-mutating, network (`sync` / `notify`), and artifact-producing
(`publish`) verbs are not exposed. `--allow-write` (ADR-0021) opts into the
guarded write slice — `new` / `compose` / `set-status`, plus `plan --save` —
projected destructive-annotated with the editor suppressed and the forge /
file-output surface still stripped; for MCP-only harnesses that cannot shell
the CLI. Behind the default-on `mcp` feature; honors `--dir`. See
[Automation & AI](../usage/automation.md#driving-adroit-over-mcp--adroit-mcp).

```sh
adroit --dir ./space mcp                 # read-only; an MCP client launches this
adroit --dir ./space mcp --allow-write   # + the guarded write slice (ADR-0021)
```

## Configuration

adroit stores configuration in `~/.config/adroit/config.yaml` (XDG on Linux, platform-appropriate elsewhere). The file is created automatically on first run with your detected editor.

```yaml
editor: vim
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dir` | path | XDG data dir | KB space root. Supports `~` and `$ENV_VAR` expansion. |
| `editor` | string | auto-detected | Preferred editor command. Include flags if needed (e.g. `code --wait`). |
| `default_template` | string | `madr` | Template used by `new`. |
| `templates_dir` | path | — | Directory of custom named templates (`<name>.md`). |
| `default_status` | status | `Proposed` | Status assigned to new ADRs. |
| `open_on_new` | bool | `true` | Open `$EDITOR` automatically after `new`. |
| `summary_path` | path | discovered | Path to a `SUMMARY.md` to regenerate on `index`. |
| `review_days` | int | `3` | Default review period (business days) for `review`. |
| `review_quorum` | int | `3` | Default approvals required for `review`. |
| `review_overdue_days` | int | `30` | A Proposed ADR older than this many days is flagged review-due even with no `review_by`. `0` disables age-based flagging. |
| `tui_theme` | `gruvbox`\|`warm`\|`default` | `gruvbox` | Color theme for the whole TUI (chrome + markdown preview). |
| `date_source` | `auto`\|`git`\|`filesystem` | `auto` | Where ADR creation/lifecycle dates come from. `git` warns if history is unavailable/shallow; `filesystem` never shells git. |
| `naming` | `sequential`\|`date`\|`uuid` | `sequential` | How ADR identifiers/filenames are formed. Pick one for the repo's lifetime — see [Naming schemes](./adr-format.md#naming-schemes). |
| `forge.provider` | `none`\|`github`\|`gitlab` | `none` | Forge integration (the `forge` feature is in the default build; `none` keeps it off). `github` drives GitHub PRs + Issues. |
| `forge.repo` | `owner/repo` | — | The provider slug (GitHub `owner/repo`). Required when a provider is set. |
| `forge.host` | host | provider default | API host for self-managed / enterprise. GitLab self-hosted: the host (`gitlab.example.com`); GitHub Enterprise: the host incl. base path (`ghe.example.com/api/v3`). Same token auth as the cloud version. |
| `forge.oauth_client_id` | string | — | Public OAuth client id for `adroit auth`'s device-flow login (no secret). Unset ⇒ `auth` prompts for a token instead. |
| `forge.branch_prefix` | string | `adr/` | Branch prefix `new --forge` generates (`adr/0021-…`). |
| `forge.base_branch` | string | `main` | Base branch PRs target. |
| `forge.tracker` | `native`\|`jira`\|`linear`\|`monday`\|`gh_issues`\|`gl_issues` | `native` | Issue tracker; `native` = the forge's own issues (`gh_issues`/`gl_issues` are explicit aliases). `jira`/`linear`/`monday` pair a GitHub/GitLab forge with a split tracker. |
| `forge.tracker_project` | string | — | Split-tracker container: Jira project key (`OPS`), Linear team key (`ENG`), or monday board id. |
| `forge.tracker_host` | host | — | Split-tracker host: Jira site (`your-site.atlassian.net`, or self-hosted) or monday account subdomain (`acme`). Unused for Linear. |
| `forge.reviewers` | list | — | Reviewer handles `review --forge` @-mentions in the kickoff comment (comma-separated; a missing `@` is added). |

Tokens are **never** stored in config. They resolve in order: the environment
(`ADROIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `ADROIT_GITLAB_TOKEN` / `ADROIT_JIRA_TOKEN` +
`ADROIT_JIRA_EMAIL` / `ADROIT_LINEAR_TOKEN` / `ADROIT_MONDAY_TOKEN`), then a local
credential file written by `adroit auth`. The `forge` feature is in the default
build (only a `--no-default-features` core omits it). **Linear** and **monday** take
a single API token, pasted via `adroit auth linear` / `adroit auth monday` (no
device flow). **Jira auth follows the deployment:**
set `ADROIT_JIRA_EMAIL` for Jira **Cloud** (Basic `email:token`); omit it for
Jira **Server/Data Center** and supply a Personal Access Token as
`ADROIT_JIRA_TOKEN` (Bearer). GitHub/GitLab use the same token whether cloud or
self-hosted — only `forge.host` changes. The integration is opt-in per command:

- `new` / `set-status` / `supersede` / `review` / `set-review` take `--forge`
  (+ `--dry-run` to preview, `--yes` to apply a mutation like a PR merge).
- `set-status <id> accepted --forge --yes` does the whole accept in one command:
  verify approvals/CI → merge the PR → close the issue → fast-forward the base
  branch → move `proposed/ → accepted/` + relink → **commit and push that relink
  commit to the base branch**, so `accepted/` lands on `main`. If the tree is
  dirty, the base diverged, or the push is rejected, it warns and leaves the move
  committed/uncommitted locally for you to push (`rejected`/`deprecated` close the
  PR instead, so they don't produce a relink commit).
- `check --forge` and `list --forge` add read-only forge awareness (drift checks
  / live PR state).
- `adroit reconcile` syncs local status with the forge after **out-of-band**
  changes (an MR merged or a tracker issue closed *outside* adroit): it reports
  drift, and with `--yes` fixes the clear case — a merged PR whose ADR isn't
  accepted — by moving it to `accepted/` (+ relink). It's **read-only on the
  forge** (never merges/closes); a closed issue on a still-proposed ADR is
  reported, not auto-fixed (accept vs won't-fix is ambiguous).
- `adroit init` is an interactive setup wizard: it detects the provider/repo
  from the git remote (confirm or override), asks for the issue tracker, writes
  `forge.*`, and optionally writes `./.env` (ADROIT_DIR — the token stays in your
  shell), drops a repo-local `adr-template.md` (MADR), and installs a pre-commit
  hook running `adroit check`. `--print` previews; `--yes` does the full setup
  non-interactively (detected forge + native tracker).
- `adroit publish --to <target> --out <dir>` renders accepted ADRs into a
  static-site shape (`static`/`mdbook`/`mkdocs`/`hugo`/`docusaurus`/`jekyll`;
  core/offline); `adroit notify <id>` posts to a Slack/Teams webhook
  (`ADROIT_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK`).
- `adroit auth <github|gitlab|jira|linear|monday> [--token <T>] [--email <E>]` saves a token to
  a `0600` `credentials.yaml` beside the config (prompts if `--token` is omitted),
  so you don't have to re-export an env var each session. Environment variables
  still take precedence; `--email` stores the Jira account email.
- The `serve` dashboard shows a **read-only** Forge panel on each ADR's detail
  page (linked issue + PR, with PR approvals / CI / merged state), fetched from
  `GET /api/adrs/{id}/forge`. It only *reads* the forge — authoring stays in the
  CLI — and renders nothing unless a provider is configured and the ADR is linked.

All keys are optional; missing keys fall back to their defaults, so older config files keep working. You can edit this file at any time to change your defaults. Set `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` to override the editor for a single session.

### Path resolution for `dir`

Relative paths in the config file resolve from the XDG data directory (typically `~/.local/share/adroit/`), not from CWD:

```yaml
# Relative — resolves to ~/.local/share/adroit/my-project/
dir: my-project

# Tilde — expands to your home directory
dir: ~/decisions

# Absolute — used as-is
dir: /opt/company/adrs
```

The `--dir` CLI flag is different: it resolves relative paths from your current working directory, as you'd expect from a shell argument.
